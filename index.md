# ProseThis - easy blogging with Prose

ProseThis adds a keyboard shortcut to any web page - CMD+k (or ctrl+k on windows), which pops open a new post window in Prose with content loaded from the current web page. It also adds appropriate metadata and creates a filename for you. The only requirement is that you are logged in to Prose, wherever you are using it, and enter the url to create a new post on your preferred repo in the extension's Options page. If you haven't entered a url, you will be prompted to do so when you activate the shortcut.

## Features

* Automatic file naming based on the page you blog from
* Adds a "link" attribute to post metadata linking to the page you reference
* Automatically adds info from Github, StackOverflow, and other pages to your Markdown

## Installation

Click this link to download the .crx file, and Chrome will ask if you want to install it as an extension. Click "Yes". On the [Extensions](chrome://extensions) page, find the ProseThis extension, and click "Options". Enter the url for a new post (which is most likely http://prose.io/#your-github-name/your-github-name.github.com/new/master/_posts) and hit "Save".

## Development

Feel free to fork and mess around with it. Pull requests will be implemented.
